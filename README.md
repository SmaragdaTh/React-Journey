  **Study & Practice** 
  
  > Use the Hints and/or Solutions only as a last resort!

  The simplest way to start experimenting with React, is by downloading the [HTML page](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) example found in the [Try React locally](https://react.dev/learn/installation#try-react-locally) section of the documentation and running it locally using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

  - [ ] [Your First Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
  - [ ] [Importing and Exporting Components](https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)
  - [ ] [Writing Markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
  - [ ] [JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces)

  **Exercises**

  Most of the chapters from the documentation above contain small exercises that will give you the chance to practice on the concepts. You can also practice on the exercises below:

  - **Cookie Notice exercise**: 
    - Inside the `DAY.01` folder, you'll find a folder named `exercises` which contains a static HTML file (`cookie-practice-original.html`) which contains a simple Cookie notice widget. Your task is to use the React quickstart HTML found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) and convert the Cookie notice widget into a React Component.
