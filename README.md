**Study & Practice**

> Use the Hints and/or Solutions only as a last resort!

The simplest way to start experimenting with React, is by downloading the [HTML page](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) example found in the [Try React locally](https://react.dev/learn/installation#try-react-locally) section of the documentation and running it locally using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

- [x] [Your First Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
- [x] [Importing and Exporting Components](https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)
- [x] [Writing Markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- [x] [JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces)

**Exercises**

Most of the chapters from the documentation above contain small exercises that will give you the chance to practice on the concepts. You can also practice on the exercises below:

- **Cookie Notice exercise**:
  - Inside the `DAY.01` folder, you'll find a folder named `exercises` which contains a static HTML file (`cookie-practice-original.html`) which contains a simple Cookie notice widget. Your task is to use the React quickstart HTML found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) and convert the Cookie notice widget into a React Component.
