## EXERCISES 

- **Build a Shopping Cart**

1. You should load the products data from the [JSON API endpoint](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and display all the product information using a Product Component.
2. Each product should have an `Add to Cart` button that adds the product to a shopping cart.
3. The shopping cart must be able to 1) remove products and 2) show the total cost of the order.

You can also run a local JSON server. Download the Fake Products JSON and import it in `json-server`. You can install `json-server` by running `npm install -g json-server`.

For the UI: Use Tailwind CSS
